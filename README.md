# Window Navigator

A GNOME Shell extension that allows you to navigate between windows using directional hotkeys.

## Features

Navigate between windows using keyboard shortcuts:
- **Super+H**: Move focus to the window on the left
- **Super+K**: Move focus to the window on the right
- **Super+U**: Move focus to the window above
- **Super+J**: Move focus to the window below

The extension finds the nearest window in the specified direction and switches focus to it, making window management more efficient without needing to use the mouse.

## Installation (from source)

```
make install
```

## Features

- Navigate between windows using hotkeys (WIP)
